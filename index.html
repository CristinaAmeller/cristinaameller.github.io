    <h1>About Me!</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hi and welcome! My name is Cristina and I live in Miami, Florida. I like everything from playing music, art direction, painting, and handbuilt ceramics. </p>
    <p>Expressing myself through art has always been second nature to me. I found my own community through these hobbies and a career that was a perfect fit for me. </p>
    <p>In this blog, I'll explain how each of my passions became apart of my life and why they are so important to me.</p>

    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>Ever since I can remember, I have been playing the drums. My dad had bought me a mini drum kit and I used it as much as I possibly could. By the time I was in the third grade</p>
    <p>I got an actual drumset so that my dad and I can play our favorite songs. I practiced as I got older and picked up the guitar. I a lot of the friends I currently have are through  </p>
    <p>our similar taste in music. This is also how I made two of my bands. We release music and play shows with other bands while also building a community through our music. Writing my </p>
    <p>experiences and sharing them with other people who can also resonate with it means a lot. </p>

    <h2>Art Direction</h2>
    <p>I'm currently studying creative advertising at the Univeristy of Miami. I always knew I was going to UM because my mom had worked there since I was in elementary school.</p>
    <p>Before I got accepted I was at FIU studying biology on a pre-med track. I went through STEM classes and even shawdowed doctors while they performed C-Sections. By the time the </p>
    <p>pandemic hit, I knew it wasnt for me. Once I looked through the program options at UM I automatically knew that it was fate. They had graphic design, art direction and typography courses.</p>
    <p>I paired this major with a studio art minor. Studying studio art made me try other art forms that helped me unlock the depths of my identity. </p>

    <h2>Studio Art</h2>
    <p>I mainily indulged in ceramics and painting courses when I picked them for my minor. Ceramics helped me learn about patience and really understanding to perfect techniques.  </p>
    <p>I've made boxes, a vase, spirit vessels and pots for flowers. I've also learned my painting style through the classes i've taken. Realism is very interesting but I think abstract art</p>
    <p>can really push you to be creative. Once I have a vision for it I'm focused on executing it.</p>
